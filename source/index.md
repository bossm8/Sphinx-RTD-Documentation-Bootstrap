# Welcome to <PROJECT_NAME>'s Documentation!

This template uses the officially supported [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sphinx/intro.html). This makes markdown and rst doc as easy as:

````bash
```{toctree}
---
maxdepth: 2
caption: Contents
---
example/doc.md
```
````

Output:

```{toctree}
---
maxdepth: 2
caption: Contents
---
example/doc.md
```

More info can be found on the official [documentation](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/syntax.html) of myst-parser.
